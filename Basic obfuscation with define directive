Below is our header file -
#define f for(i=0;i<5;i++)

With the .c file being as below:
#include <stdio.h>
#include "obfus_define.h"

int main(){
        int i;
        f{printf("Hello");};
        return 0;
}

If we hid the header file an outsider wouldn't know what to make of this, or even that the printf command is being executed 5 times. Of course if they compile it they'll understand - but this is the basic obfuscation.
